<p>Brief description of your approach and any challenges faced</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>It was relatively easy to complete the assignment, it was almost as
if there was too much direction. Not having to worry about the structure
of the code and the chain of functions from main all the day to the
helper functions was nice as it allowed me to focus on how NTP actually
worked, but having descriptions of each and every step to implmeenting a
function meant it was more about me trying to remember how to write
c. </p>
<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<p>I git cloned the repository onto tux and then mounted them onto my
macbook using sshfs. This allowed me to compile and run on linux on tux
but edit using my local vim config. Then I read all the starter code and
traced through the flow of the program, reading the man pages for a few
aspects I didn’t understand. The I simply searched for the TODOS and
implemented each one in the order defined.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-faced">Challenges Faced</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Understanding the initial codebase It was nothing hard to understand
I was just diligent in trying to remember what I could about c, and then
learning what I haven’t seen that was new in the code provided. I wanted
to understand the socket interface a little better so I read the man
pages for that and asked an LLM about the different socket types and
af_families. Also I read the man pages and went through a few example
scripts on understanding the getopt functionality.</li>
<li>Debugging the print_ntp_packet_info The root delay and root
dispersion were displaying as 0 for the server at first (and 0 for the
client but that is due to those fields being prefilled as 0). I tried to
fill in the client packet with 1 &lt;&lt; 16 + 2 which when printed
should display 1.000… with some small decimal at the end for the <span
class="math display">2 * 2<sup>−32</sup></span> from the 2 fractions,
instead it displayed 1001. I figured out the macro in ntp-protocol.h was
messed up for GET_NTP_Q1616_TS so when I fixed it then it finally
worked. This was probably the most annoying bug to find because I was so
close to finishing the assignment, and it took a long while because I
wasn’t even looking at the macro as a source of the error as it wasn’t
in the functions I implemented.</li>
</ul>
